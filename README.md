## Yeoman Insights Dashboard

### Running locally:

Install all dependencies:
  - `yeoman install`
  - `npm install`

This app uses redis as a caching mechanism. Start the redis server:
  - `redis-server`

Start yeoman and node server:
  - `yeoman server` (ignore the browser window that opens, correct port is 3000)
  - `node server/server.js`

Presto!
